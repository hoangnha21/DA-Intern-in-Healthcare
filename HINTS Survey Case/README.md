The Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) is a biennial, cross-sectional survey of a nationally-representative sample of American adults that is used to assess the impact of the health information environment. Specifically, HINTS measures how people access and use health information; how people use information technology to manage health and health information; and the degree to which people are engaged in healthy behaviors. Finally, several items in HINTS have a specific focus on cancer prevention and control.

Customer surveys can have a huge impact on your organization. Whether that impact is positive or negative depends on how good the survey is. → importance of survey analysis
