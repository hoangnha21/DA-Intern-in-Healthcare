Problem Statements 

-There was a major problem of variation in the number of surgeries performed daily.
-Knowing the expected number of surgeries would allow the Operating Room managers to schedule the surgeries properly with the correct number of staff which helps to match the demand.

Objectives

-We are using the elective surgery schedule from a few weeks prior to the actual surgery date to predict the final number of surgeries to be performed using the Linear Regression model. 

  *Resolves the issue of variation in daily surgical case volume
  
  *Improves the problems of surgical staff scheduling.
